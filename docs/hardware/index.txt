Installing LiMe is not always as easy as we would like to.
It depends on the router model, revision and so on.
The best way for getting an updated set of instructions is to find your
model on OpenWRT or LEDE web pages. However to cover some specific scenarios,
we provide a list of articles which might help you.

Please, take into account that these pages are third-party contributed, so if
you find the opportunity send us your contribution via git pull-request or mail.
